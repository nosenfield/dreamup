    "content": "This is a mouse-only clicker/idle game. Players interact by clicking on bricks in the game grid multiple times to destroy them. Each brick displays a number (e.g., '1', '2', '3') which indicates how many times that brick must be clicked before it is destroyed. Lower-numbered bricks require fewer clicks and are easier to destroy. Destroying bricks earns money. The game is entirely mouse-driven with no keyboard controls required. The primary mechanic is clicking bricks repeatedly until they are destroyed based on their displayed number."

Click each brick repeatedly until its number reaches zero and it is destroyed. Prioritize bricks with lower numbers (e.g., '1', '2') as they require fewer clicks and provide faster feedback. The brick grid occupies the center portion of the screen within a white border frame. Observe how brick numbers decrease with each click. Continue clicking bricks systematically to destroy them and earn money. The money counter is displayed at the top-right with a dollar sign icon and will increase when bricks are successfully destroyed."
