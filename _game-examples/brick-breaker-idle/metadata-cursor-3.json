Each brick displays a number indicating how many clicks are required to destroy it. Destroying bricks earns money, which can be spent on purchasing balls to automate brick breaking. The game features a grid of numbered bricks, a money counter, and ball purchase buttons.",

    "content": "This is a mouse-only clicker/idle game. Players interact by clicking on bricks in the game grid multiple times to destroy them. Each brick displays a number (e.g., '1', '2', '3') which indicates how many times that brick must be clicked before it is destroyed. Lower-numbered bricks require fewer clicks and are easier to destroy. Destroying bricks earns money. Money can be spent by clicking on ball purchase buttons (yellow circular button labeled $25 and magenta/pink circular button labeled $200 at top-left) to buy balls that automate brick destruction. The game is entirely mouse-driven with no keyboard controls required. The primary gameplay loop is: click bricks repeatedly to destroy them and earn money, then spend money to purchase balls that automate the brick-breaking process."

    "instructions": "Phase 1 - Click bricks to earn money: Focus exclusively on clicking bricks in the central grid area. Each brick displays a number indicating how many clicks are required to destroy it. Click each brick repeatedly until its number reaches zero and it is destroyed. Prioritize bricks with lower numbers (e.g., '1', '2') as they require fewer clicks and provide faster feedback. The brick grid occupies the center portion of the screen within a white border frame. Observe how brick numbers decrease with each click. Continue clicking bricks systematically to destroy them and earn money. The money counter is displayed at the top-right with a dollar sign icon and will increase when bricks are successfully destroyed. Phase 2 - Purchase balls: After earning enough money (at least $25), click on the ball purchase buttons at the top-left of the screen. The yellow circular button labeled $25 purchases one ball, and the magenta/pink circular button labeled $200 purchases multiple balls. These balls will automate the brick-breaking process. Continue alternating between clicking bricks to earn money and purchasing balls to automate progress."
