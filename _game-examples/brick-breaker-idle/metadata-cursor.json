After earning enough money, click on the ball purchase buttons (yellow circular button $25 and magenta circular button $200 at top-left) to buy balls. Prioritize clicking on lower-numbered bricks as they are easier to destroy and provide immediate feedback. The money counter is displayed at the top-right with a dollar sign icon. The primary goal is to earn money by clicking bricks, then spend that money to purchase balls that will automate the brick-breaking process."
