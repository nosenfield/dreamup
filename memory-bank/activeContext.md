# Active Context: DreamUp

**Last Updated**: November 8, 2025
**Session**: Multiple Action Recommendations Feature

---

## Current Focus

### ✨ FEATURE: Multiple Action Recommendations (1-20 actions)

**Goal**: Allow LLM to return 1-20 actions per state analysis, all of which will be tried in sequence (no early stop on success). This is especially useful for idle games requiring many clicks to progress.

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE

## Refactor Progress

### ✅ Phase 1.1: Enhanced Logger with Phase Separation - COMPLETE (Nov 8, 2025)
- Added TestPhase enum with 9 test phases
- Added beginPhase() and endPhase() methods with visual banners
- Added action() method with formatted details (click, keypress, screenshot)
- Added trace() method for very detailed logging
- Implemented level-based logging (LOG_LEVEL environment variable)
- Maintained backward compatibility (DEBUG flag still works)
- All 38 logger tests passing

### ✅ Phase 2: Start Button Detection - Code Separation - COMPLETE (Nov 8, 2025)
- Created `src/core/start-detection/` directory
- Implemented Strategy Pattern with 4 separate strategy files:
  - `base-strategy.ts` - Abstract base class
  - `dom-strategy.ts` - DOM selector strategy (22 selectors)
  - `natural-language-strategy.ts` - Stagehand natural language
  - `vision-strategy.ts` - GPT-4 Vision element detection
  - `state-analysis-strategy.ts` - LLM state analysis
- Implemented `StartDetector` orchestrator class
- Extracted 267 lines from `game-interactor.ts` (replaced with 12-line delegation)
- All 17 new tests passing (base, DOM, natural language strategies)
- All 38 existing GameInteractor tests passing (backward compatible)
- Logging shows phase banners and action details correctly

### ✅ Phase 3: Adaptive QA Loop - Code Separation - COMPLETE (Nov 8, 2025)
- Created `src/core/adaptive-qa-loop.ts` with `AdaptiveQALoop` class
- Extracted 115 lines from `main.ts` (replaced with 10-line delegation)
- Implemented `AdaptiveLoopResult` interface
- All 10 new tests passing
- All 60 existing integration tests passing (backward compatible)
- Logging shows phase banners and action details correctly

### 📋 Phase 4: Screenshot Timing Fix - NEXT (1 hour)
- Add pre-start screenshot capture
- Update ScreenshotStage type

### 📋 Phase 5: Error Handling Improvements - PENDING (2 hours)
- Create structured error types
- Improve error categorization

---

## Project Status

### MVP Complete ✅
- All Iteration 5 tasks finished (Nov 5-7, 2025)
- Production-ready codebase
- Comprehensive documentation

### Post-MVP Enhancements
- **Adaptive Agent Enhancements** (T1 Complete, T2-T5 Pending)
  - T1: Simplified metadata structure ✅
  - T2: Enhanced StateAnalyzer prompts (NEXT after refactor)

---

## Recent Changes

### Completed This Session
- ✅ Multiple Action Recommendations Feature (Nov 8, 2025)
  - Updated schema to return array of 1-20 action recommendations
  - Updated StateAnalyzer to return array instead of single recommendation
  - Updated prompt to instruct LLM to return 1-20 actions ordered by priority
  - Updated AdaptiveQALoop to try ALL actions in sequence (no early stop on success)
  - All 20 tests passing (StateAnalyzer + AdaptiveQALoop)
  - Supports idle games requiring 100+ clicks to progress
- ✅ Phase 2: Start Button Detection - Code Separation (Nov 8, 2025)
  - Created `src/core/start-detection/` directory with 7 files
  - Implemented Strategy Pattern with 4 strategies
  - Extracted 267 lines from `game-interactor.ts`
  - All 17 new tests passing, all 38 existing tests passing
  - Logging shows phase banners and action details correctly
- ✅ Refactor planning and documentation (Nov 8, 2025)
  - Created comprehensive refactor plan in `_docs/refactor-plan.md`
  - Analyzed current QA process flow
  - Clarified VisionAnalyzer vs StateAnalyzer usage
  - Identified screenshot timing issue
  - Documented Stagehand integration questions

### Completed Previous Session
- ✅ T1: Simplified metadata structure (Nov 7, 2025)
- ✅ Phase 3: Adaptive QA loop implementation (Nov 5, 2025)
- ✅ Phase 2: LLM State Analyzer (Nov 5, 2025)
- ✅ Iteration 5: Input Schema & Polish - COMPLETE (Nov 5, 2025)

## Key Files for Refactor

### Being Refactored
- `src/utils/logger.ts` - Enhanced with phase separation ✅
- `src/core/game-interactor.ts` - Start detection extracted ✅ (Phase 2)
- `src/main.ts` - Adaptive loop extracted ✅ (Phase 3)

### New Files Created
- `src/core/start-detection/` - Strategy pattern implementation ✅ (Phase 2)
  - `base-strategy.ts`, `dom-strategy.ts`, `natural-language-strategy.ts`
  - `vision-strategy.ts`, `state-analysis-strategy.ts`, `start-detector.ts`
  - `index.ts` - Module exports
- `src/core/adaptive-qa-loop.ts` - Extracted loop logic ✅ (Phase 3)
  - `AdaptiveQALoop` class with `run()` method
  - `AdaptiveLoopResult` interface

### New Files to Create
- `src/utils/errors.ts` - Structured error types (Phase 5)

## Active Decisions

### Refactor Decisions
1. **Approach**: Refactor in place (not parallel implementation)
2. **Branch**: `refactor/logging-and-separation` (preserve current state)
3. **Screenshot Timing**: Keep 3 screenshots, reorder capture (Option B)
4. **Logging**: Clear phase banners + action details
5. **Code Separation**: Strategy Pattern for start detection
6. **Adaptive Loop**: Extract to dedicated class
7. **Backward Compatibility**: Not required for metadata files

### Priority Rankings
1. **P1 (Critical)**: Logging improvements, Code separation
2. **P2 (High)**: Error handling improvements
3. **P3 (Medium)**: Screenshot timing fix
4. **P4 (Low)**: Documentation updates

## Context for Next Session

### If Starting New Session
1. Read this file (activeContext.md)
2. Read `_docs/refactor-plan.md` for implementation details
3. Check current branch: `refactor/logging-and-separation`

### If Continuing Refactor
1. Phase 1.1 ✅ Complete - Logger enhanced
2. **Next**: Phase 2 (Start Button Detection - Code Separation)
3. Follow step-by-step plan in `_docs/refactor-plan.md`

---

## Success Criteria

**Refactor Complete When**:
- ✅ Logging: Can identify issue phase within 30 seconds from logs
- ✅ Code Separation: Start strategies in separate files (<150 lines each)
- ✅ Code Separation: Adaptive loop extracted (<400 lines main.ts)
- ✅ Maintainability: New strategy requires 1 file + 1 line in orchestrator
- ✅ Functionality: All existing test games pass with same scores
- ✅ Screenshot Timing: Vision receives pre-start baseline

---

## Known Issues

None - all tests passing (38 logger tests after Phase 1.1)
