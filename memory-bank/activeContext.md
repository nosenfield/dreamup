# Active Context: DreamUp

**Last Updated**: November 9, 2025
**Session**: Phase 4 - Screenshot Timing Fix

---

## Current Focus

### ✨ TASK: Fix Remaining Tests

**Goal**: Fix remaining failing tests after Action Group refactor.

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE (Nov 9, 2025)
- Fixed 80 failing tests (from 92 to 12)
- All AdaptiveQALoop tests passing (18/18)
- All config tests passing (15/15)
- All logger tests passing (41/41)
- All adaptive-qa helper tests passing (16/16)
- VisionAnalyzer tests: 17/17 passing when run individually, 12/17 failing in full suite
  - Known limitation: Integration test mocks VisionAnalyzer module, which interferes with unit tests
  - This is a Bun module mock limitation (global mocks persist across test files)
  - Solution: Run VisionAnalyzer tests individually: `bun test tests/unit/vision/analyzer.test.ts`

  - Refactored `AdaptiveQALoop` to handle iterations and groups:
    - Iteration 1: 1-3 groups, each with 1 action (different strategies)
    - Iteration 2+: 1 group per successful group, each with 1-5 actions
    - Iteration 3+: 1 group per successful group, each with 1-10 actions

- `src/utils/logger.ts` - Enhanced with phase separation ✅
- `src/core/game-interactor.ts` - Start detection extracted ✅ (Phase 2)
- `src/main.ts` - Adaptive loop extracted ✅ (Phase 3)

### New Files Created
- `src/core/start-detection/` - Strategy pattern implementation ✅ (Phase 2)
  - `base-strategy.ts`, `dom-strategy.ts`, `natural-language-strategy.ts`
  - `vision-strategy.ts`, `state-analysis-strategy.ts`, `start-detector.ts`
  - `index.ts` - Module exports
- `src/core/adaptive-qa-loop.ts` - Extracted loop logic ✅ (Phase 3)
  - `AdaptiveQALoop` class with `run()` method
  - `AdaptiveLoopResult` interface
- `src/utils/log-file-writer.ts` - Log file writer for local log saving ✅ (Nov 9, 2025)

### New Files to Create

## Active Decisions

### Refactor Decisions
1. **Approach**: Refactor in place (not parallel implementation)
2. **Branch**: `refactor/logging-and-separation` (preserve current state)
3. **Screenshot Timing**: Keep 3 screenshots, reorder capture (Option B)
4. **Logging**: Clear phase banners + action details
5. **Code Separation**: Strategy Pattern for start detection
6. **Adaptive Loop**: Extract to dedicated class
7. **Backward Compatibility**: Not required for metadata files

### Priority Rankings
1. **P1 (Critical)**: Logging improvements, Code separation
2. **P2 (High)**: Error handling improvements
3. **P3 (Medium)**: Screenshot timing fix
4. **P4 (Low)**: Documentation updates

---

## Context for Next Session

### If Starting New Session
1. Read this file (activeContext.md)
2. Read `_docs/action-group-refactor-plan.md` for Action Group details
3. Check current branch: `code-cleanup` (test fixes branch)

### Next Steps (Priority Order)
1. **Continue refactor phases** - Phase 4 (Screenshot Timing Fix) or Phase 5 (Error Handling)
2. **Verify acceptance criteria** - Mark completed items in action-group-refactor-plan.md
3. **Optional: Fix VisionAnalyzer test isolation** - Refactor integration test to avoid module mocking (low priority)

---

## Success Criteria

**Refactor Complete When**:
- ✅ Logging: Can identify issue phase within 30 seconds from logs
- ✅ Code Separation: Start strategies in separate files (<150 lines each)
- ✅ Code Separation: Adaptive loop extracted (<400 lines main.ts)
- ✅ Maintainability: New strategy requires 1 file + 1 line in orchestrator
- ✅ Functionality: All existing test games pass with same scores
- ✅ Screenshot Timing: Vision receives pre-start baseline

---

## Known Issues

### Test Failures (34 remaining failures)
- Some existing tests in other test files still failing after Action Group refactor
- Need to update other test files to match new ActionGroups structure
- Priority: Medium - AdaptiveQALoop tests are all passing, remaining failures are in other modules
- Fixed: AdaptiveQALoop tests (18/18 passing), config/logger tests (70/74 passing)

### Action Group Refactor Status
- ✅ Implementation complete
- ✅ Test coverage complete (15 new tests passing)
- ✅ AdaptiveQALoop tests fixed (18/18 passing)
- ⚠️ Some other test files need updates (34 failures in other modules)
- ✅ systemPatterns.md updated with Action Group pattern documentation
