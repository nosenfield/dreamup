# Active Context: DreamUp

**Last Updated**: November 4, 2025
**Session**: Iteration 1 - I1.1 Complete (Browser Manager)

---

## Current Focus

### 🔄 MAJOR STRATEGIC PIVOT
**Adopting Iterative Development** based on expert recommendation and game engine context.

**Why the change?**
- De-risk Browserbase integration early (validate in 2-3 hours, not 30+)
- Test with real games after each iteration
- Build working software incrementally
- Expert recommendation: "Create minimal agent → add one interaction at a time"

**What changed?**
- Task list reorganized from linear phases (P3-P7) to 5 iterations
- Original detailed plan archived in `task-list-waterfall-original.md`
- New iteration-based plan in `task-list.md`
- Same work, different execution order

### What We're Working On
✅ **Foundation Complete** (Phases 0-2):
- Phase 0: Project Setup (4/4 tasks)
- Phase 1: Types & Config (3/3 tasks) + InputSchema enhancement
- Phase 2: Utilities (3/3 tasks)

🔄 **Iteration 1: Minimal Working Agent** - In Progress
- ✅ I1.1: Implement Browser Manager - COMPLETE
- 🔄 I1.2: Implement Minimal Main Orchestration - Next

### Next Immediate Tasks
1. **I1.2: Implement Minimal Main Orchestration** (1 hour)
   - Create minimal `runQA()` function in `src/main.ts`
   - Generate session ID, initialize BrowserManager
   - Navigate to game URL, take screenshot
   - Return minimal result
   - Add CLI entry point
2. Test with real game to verify Browserbase integration
3. **Iteration 2**: Basic Interaction (I2.1: Implement Basic Game Interactor)

## Recent Changes

### Completed This Session (Latest)
- ✅ **I1.1: Implement Browser Manager**
  - Created `src/core/browser-manager.ts` with BrowserManager class
  - Implemented `initialize()` - Creates Browserbase session, connects Stagehand
  - Implemented `navigate(url)` - Navigates to URL with networkidle wait
  - Implemented `cleanup()` - Closes browser session and releases resources
  - Added comprehensive error handling with structured logging
  - All operations wrapped with timeout utilities
  - Created `src/core/index.ts` to export BrowserManager
  - Integration tests: 11 tests, all passing
  - TypeScript compilation passes
  - Follows dependency injection pattern
  - Uses existing Logger and timeout utilities
  - **Acceptance Criteria Met**: ✅ Browser initializes, ✅ Can navigate, ✅ Cleanup works, ✅ Errors caught/logged

- ✅ **Strategic Pivot to Iterative Development**
  - Received expert recommendation: build minimal agent first, test early and often
  - Received game engine context (scene stack, input system with actions/axes)
  - Reorganized Phases 3-7 into 5 iterations
  - Archived original detailed waterfall plan in `task-list-waterfall-original.md`
  - Created new iteration-based `task-list.md`:
    - Iteration 1: Minimal Working Agent (validate Browserbase)
    - Iteration 2: Basic Interaction (keyboard inputs)
    - Iteration 3: Detection & Monitoring (game type, console errors)
    - Iteration 4: Vision Analysis (GPT-4V integration)
    - Iteration 5: Input Schema & Polish (production ready)
  - Each iteration ends with real game testing
  - De-risks assumptions early (Browserbase works in 2-3 hrs, not 30+)
  - Produces working software incrementally

- ✅ **Enhanced Type Definitions: Added InputSchema support**
  - Added `InputSchema` interface to `src/types/game-test.types.ts`
    - Supports `type: 'javascript' | 'semantic'` for first-party vs third-party games
    - Includes `content` field for JS snippets or semantic descriptions
    - Optional `actions?: string[]` for discrete button events (Jump, Shoot)
    - Optional `axes?: string[]` for continuous inputs (MoveHorizontal, -1 to 1 range)
  - Updated `GameTestRequest` interface with optional `inputSchema?: InputSchema` field
  - Updated `src/types/index.ts` to export InputSchema
  - Added 3 new unit tests in `tests/unit/types.test.ts`:
    - Test InputSchema type imports correctly
    - Test GameTestRequest accepts inputSchema field
    - Test both javascript and semantic schema types work
  - All tests passing (5 tests total in types.test.ts)
  - TypeScript compilation passes (`bunx tsc --noEmit`)
  - **Rationale**: Some games provide additional information about their construction and controls to help QA agent understand how to interact with them

## Active Decisions

### Technical Decisions Made
1. **Runtime**: Bun (not Node.js) for fast startup and native TypeScript
2. **Browser**: Browserbase + Stagehand (not Puppeteer) for managed infrastructure
3. **AI**: GPT-4 Vision via Vercel AI SDK with Zod structured outputs
4. **Deployment**: AWS Lambda with 2048MB memory, 10-minute timeout
5. **Error handling**: Fail immediately, no retry logic in MVP
6. **Screenshots**: Keep all screenshots, no cleanup in MVP
7. **Caching**: Disabled for MVP, stub implementation for future
8. **Environment Variables**: Bun automatically loads `.env` files, so `dotenv` package is not needed

### Strategic Decisions Made
9. **Development Approach**: Iterative (not waterfall/linear phases)
   - Build minimal working agent first (Iteration 1: 2-3 hours)
   - Test with real games after each iteration
   - Add one feature at a time (keyboard → detection → vision → polish)
   - Expert recommendation: validates assumptions early, reduces risk
   - Original waterfall plan preserved in `task-list-waterfall-original.md`
10. **Input Schema Support**: Added InputSchema interface to support game-specific control information
   - First-party games provide JavaScript snippets ('javascript' type)
   - Third-party games provide semantic descriptions ('semantic' type)
   - Supports both discrete actions (Jump, Shoot) and continuous axes (MoveHorizontal)
   - Optional field in GameTestRequest to maintain backward compatibility
   - Enables targeted testing based on game engine's input system
